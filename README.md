# spring-boot-template

Quick template for starting a spring boot application.

## Information

### Requirement

1. Java JDK 21+

### Setup

This project requires no IDE to get started however, I highly recommend using Intellij IDEA
Community (which is free) or Intellij Ultimate (which contains a lot of useful tools for building
spring-boot applications).

Secondly, I strongly recommend using the style guide provided in the root of the project and turn on
autoformatting in Intellij. Follow
[Code style schemes](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-code-style.html) for help on
how to add it to your project.
