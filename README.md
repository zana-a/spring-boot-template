# spring-boot-template

Quick template for starting a spring boot application.

## Information

### Requirement

1. Java JDK 21+

### Setup

This project requires no IDE to get started however, I highly recommend using Intellij IDEA
Community (which is free) or Intellij Ultimate (which contains a lot of useful tools for building
spring-boot applications).
